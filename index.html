                                One of my favourite things about this series is its writing of the characters. Particularly with Shigeo and Reigen, who are easily my favourite part of the series. Their student/teacher relationship is among some of the best in all of anime, and this season we are treated to some of the finest emotional moments between the two.

                            <p class="text-light text-left">They said it couldn't be done, but Studio Bones gave us a masterpiece adaptation of Mob Psycho 100, with a final season that captured what makes the web manga so special and endearing, while adding spectacular visuals that enhance the emotional story of Shigeo Kageyama. Few anime manage to make you cheer, laugh, cry, and reflect on life as often as Mob Psycho 100 does, let alone do all that as part of an elaborate and absurd gag. The third season does all that while also tying up loose ends and giving us satisfying conclusions to every character arc. Make no mistake, Mob Psycho 100 III will go down as one of the all-time greatest anime finales ever made.

                                For three seasons we followed Shigeo Kageyama, aka Mob, in his attempts to become popular and have a normal life with friends and those who care about him in spite of his extraordinary psychic abilities, and slowly gain confidence in himself as he builds a support network around him. This season brought every plotline and every character arc to a boiling point, starting with the giant broccoli Mob created that is now towering in the center of the town.</p>

                        While the workflow remains the same, Mob isn't just blindly following Reigen around anymore. With all his experiences as a ridiculously strong psychic, Mob's supernatural adventures now have more weight to them. Things take on a serious and darker tone as the dangers Mob and Reigen face are much more tangible and unsettling than ever before.
